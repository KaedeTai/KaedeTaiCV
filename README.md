## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Serial entrepreneur and high-frequency quantitative trader with expertise in cybersecurity and technology infrastructure. Combines cross-disciplinary technical background with business acumen to transform innovative concepts into scalable, deployable products and systems. Passionate about leveraging technology and finance to create meaningful impact, driven by a commitment to making the world a better place through practical solutions.

From the invention of the computer and the rise of the Internet, to mobile commerce, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and now AI reshaping the world, I have stayed on the front line as a hands-on builder and leader. My experience spans contributing to open-source projects as an individual, building teams from zero, and leading teams within large telecoms and technology companies. As delivery methodologies evolved—from waterfall and Agile to Lean Startup and today’s AI copilot-driven vibe coding—the only thing that has never changed is my commitment to building exceptional teams and guiding them through challenges to achieve ambitious goals.
